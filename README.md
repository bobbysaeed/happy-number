# Happy Number Checker

This is a simple Python script that checks whether a given number is a **happy number**.

A **happy number** is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the squares of each digit repeatedly. If it loops endlessly without reaching 1, it is considered **not** a happy number.

## ðŸ“œ How It Works

- The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
- It validates the input to ensure it is a valid number.
- It checks if the number is happy using the defined logic.
- The result is printed to the console.
